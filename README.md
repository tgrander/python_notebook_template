# Notebook Project Template

## Overview

This project template is designed for data science and analytics workflows using Jupyter Notebooks. It provides a structured and standardized way to organize code, data, and outputs for efficient and reproducible research.

## Structure

The template is organized into the following directories:

- **`data/`**: Contains raw and processed data.
  - `raw/`: Stores the original, unaltered data.
  - `processed/`: Holds data that has been cleaned, transformed, or otherwise processed.
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) used for analysis and data processing.
- **`scripts/`**: For standalone Python scripts, often used for more complex or reusable code.
- **`utils/`**: Includes utility functions and helper scripts.
- **`outputs/`**: Stores the results and products of analyses.
  - `figures/`: For plots, charts, and other visualizations.
  - `data/`: Final or exported data sets, ready for sharing or publishing.
  - `logs/`: Log files for tracking and debugging.
  - `models/`: Trained machine learning model files.
  - `summaries/`: Textual output such as reports and summaries.
- **`env/`**: Virtual environment directory (not tracked by version control).

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Environment**: 
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
   - Activate the environment:
     - Windows: `.\env\Scripts\activate`
     - Unix/macOS: `source env/bin/activate`
   - Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Working with Notebooks**:
   - Jupyter notebooks are located in the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Start JupyterLab with `jupyter lab` and open notebooks from the interface.

3. **Using the Data Directory**:
   - Place your raw data in `data/raw/`.
   - Save processed data in `data/processed/`.

4. **Scripts and Utilities**:
   - Store reusable scripts in `scripts/`.
   - Place utility functions in `utils/`.

5. **Saving Outputs**:
   - Save figures and plots in `outputs/figures/`.
   - Export final data sets to `outputs/data/`.

6. **Logging**:
   - Generate and store log files in `outputs/logs/`.

## Best Practices

- Keep raw data immutable to maintain data integrity.
- Document each step in your Jupyter notebooks for clarity and reproducibility.
- Write modular and reusable code in scripts and utility functions.
- Regularly commit changes to version control.
